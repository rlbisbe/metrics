#Metrics

Metrics is a social app that connects you to your most important stats.

Stats available right now:

## Twitter:
At the moment, the program counts only the followers.

## Facebook:
Right now only count the likes of certain facebook pages.

## Wordpress
Here we count the blog visits today.
Other possible stats would be weekly stats or monthly stats.
For V2: Difference between months, in percentage.
	
## Tuenti
Right now we count the Likes from the tuenti pages.
For V1: Add the full name, not only the url.
	
## Github
By now, only open issues are shown.

## API:
The idea is to offer an API in different programming languages (PHP and .net as first-class)

Also, provide a common Json that will be interpreted by the system.
